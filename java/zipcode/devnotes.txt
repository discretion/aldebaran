Notes from Ass #9
#########################################################
This program is like the first ZIPcode program, with two additions: It reads from a database (like the molarmass assignment) and populates an array, and it has to find all ZIP codes within a maximum distance specified as an argument by the user.

1. Load info from URL like so:
URL url = new URL("whateverurl");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
Scanner zipScanner = new Scanner(conn.getInputStream());

2. two cmd line arguments:
  a. ZIP code
  b. max distance in km

3. Prints info on the ZIPs along w/ each distance.
  a. Format exactly like the demo.
